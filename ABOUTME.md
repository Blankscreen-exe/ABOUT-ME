# Hey! Hammad Here ...

I'm a young **Computer Scientist** who *just* [^1] graduated from **University of Karachi**. My core interests are **Machine Learning**, **AI** and **Data Science**. Although I do already have academic level of skills for my *said interests*, I am still studying more about their practical approaches from IBM, Harvard, Oracle, Huawei and other online portals.

My **key technical skills** (which are not limited to) are as follows:
1. *Programming Languages*
: Python, Java, Javascript, R, Lua
2. *Softwares & other skills* <!-- will add python libraries -->
: Django Web Framework, REST, Watson Studio, Database Management, ML Algos, Data Science and more


Apart from all that tech subject matter, I like to read and write(no pun intented). I am currently practicing my habit as a diligent reader on **IBM Machine Learning** Documentaions (It is one of the most awesome Docs I've seen yet, so I'll be indulging myself in those for the time being). As for my writing skills I started off with publishing as a kid on Wattpad.com but then came my knowledge of Computer Science and I joined [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@muhammadhammadhassan002/about). I plan to publish lots of my ideas there for other readers like me and also learn a whole lot from others. 

I'm looking forward to working in Data Science and Machine Learning Projects. My professional prescence, current skill-set as well as all of my updated information will be found at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-hammad-hassan-cs101). Feel free to have a look.

[^1]: I will finish it on Jan 2022.
